A Half-Built Garden, by Ruthanna Emrys. 

It features a post-climate change Earth where humans are divided into three blocs. Corporations have built and colonized artificial islands in an effort to escape the worst of the effects of climate change. The other two blocs, vestigial nation-states and polities called “watersheds”, share the same terrain but work along different principles. Watersheds are semi-sovereign entities created to steward the basins of each river on Earth. Since ecology interconnects everything – and the other two blocs have proven ineffective, or worse, at preserving survivable conditions, they end up in charge of most infrastructures and public services. The watersheds’ economy is not described in detail (the book focuses rather on their governance model), but it seems in line with most solarpunk fiction. The most salient economic fact is the presence of a planetary economy where late-stage capitalism co-exists (uneasily) with a commons-based economy of sorts.
