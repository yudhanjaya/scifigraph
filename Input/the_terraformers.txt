The Terraformers by Annalee Newitz. 

Imagines a universe where FTL is travel, and exoplanets are terraformed either by a public-sector body, the Rangers, or by corporations as real estate investment. There are also mixed jurisdictions, where corporations do the work and reap the benefits, but the Rangers enforce some safeguards. The action is on such a mixed-jurisdiction planet. Terroforming is nearly complete, and the coproration in question is starting to sell the first lots to its clients.This creates a friction with the Rangers, as well as with a community of descendants on the early colonists, bio-engineered for a not-yet-terraformed planet. The whole thing is basically an anti-gentrification struggle blown to planetary proportion, with the Rangers being a potential deal broker in the process. It highlights the value of science fiction in making real-world economic and social dynamics such as gentrification.
