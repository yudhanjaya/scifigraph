Gamechanger, by L. X. Beckett. 

It depicts a world trying, and mostly succeeding, to come back from the brink of climate- and civilizational collapse, as the backdrop to a very dense plot. Beckettâ€™s economy has several radical elements: a dual system where basic goods and services are free, but luxuries are scarce, and many severely rationed (for example, almost no one is allowed to keep pets); a social credit scoring system; carbon as a currency. These elements, however, do not manage to feel like a coherent system. The main inconsistency I see is the comprehensive augmented-reality infosphere that seems to cover the entire planet. This kind of thing requires investments that would have competed with those needed to abate greenhouse gases emissions, revamp the Amazon and in general undo the damage done by the previous eras of profligacy.
