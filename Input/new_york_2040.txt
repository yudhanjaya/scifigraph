New York 2140, by Kim Stanley Robinson. 

It depicts a future New York City where see levels went up 15 meters, and submerged much of the city, including Lower Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx. This drove real estate values to near-zero: as a result, capital withdrew inland and urban climate refugees (“water rats”) were left to fend for themselves. The city becomes divided into above-water Uptown, home to second homes for the ultra-rich, and the Intertidal, the area between the low tide and and a high tide mark, which is (barely) inhabitable thanks to technological improvement in waterproofing and material science in general. In the Intertidal, the work of re-purposing and adapting the existing building stock is done by water rats, who organize according to a molteplicity of economic models (“in the years after the flooding there was a proliferation of cooperatives, neighborhood associations, communes, squats, barter, alternative currencies, gift economies, solar usufruct, fishing village cultures, mondragons, unions, Davy’s locker freemasonries, anarchist blather, and submarine technoculture, including aeration and aquafarming […]”). Notably, KSR sees this as a sort of controlled experiment, still in the hands of late-stage capitalist élites (“Wait and see what those crazy people did with it, and if it was good, buy it. As always, right?”), This points to the risk of exploitation implicit in socially innovative practices.
