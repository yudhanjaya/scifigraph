Our Shared Storm: A Movel of Five Climate Futures, by Andrew Dana Hudson. 

This novel builds five worlds, all centered in Buenos Aires in 2054 during COP, and each one based on one of the five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) prepared by the IPCC for their Sixth Assessment Report. Some of the scenarios are heavy on economics, others less so. SSP5 is hyper-capitalistic, reminiscent of certain cyberpunk literature; SSP4 is defined by “decarbonization for the rich”, where high inequality limits the emissions of the poor; and SSP1 is a more solarpunk future that has transitioned.
