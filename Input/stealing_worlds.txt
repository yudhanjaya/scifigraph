Stealing Worlds, by Karl Schroeder. 

Both plot and worldbuilding of this novel are unusually rich. From an economic standpoint, the two main devices are (1) the rise of in-game economies, whereby people can earn virtual gold by working in mixed reality games, for example accepting to act as non-playing characters. Eventually these economies end up replacing the “real” one. And (2) fully trustable, pervasive blockchains, which anchor not only designer currencies (for example inflationary ones) but also smart contracts. This unlocks the possibility for non-human entities, like river basins or forests or glaciers, to spawn DAOs that work on their behalf with no human at the helm, and to have human-ish looking avatars and even personalities, via the game engines. Climate change has been contained, just about, by a strict social credit scoring that freely gives people necessities, but will only release luxuries to those that maintain a prosocial behavior. Ubiquitous surveillance means that the collective’s power to induce such behaviour is quite strong: human reproduction is regulated, pets are almost universally prohibited. The idea that the “real economy” is pushing more and more people into poverty and debt slavery is reminescent of Doctorow’s Walkaway. There is, however, a bit of an inconsistency: if the world is fighting disruptive climate change and restrictions on resources, where did the investments to create flawless mixed reality everywhere come from? Given the conflicts, where did the political goodwill to create harmonious technical standards that make everything interoperable with anything else, even to a full Internet of Things? In general, production is somewhat absent: things just appear, delivered by drones. Also, blockchains in this world have not gone scammy like in ours.
